Based on the provided text, I will tabulate the response as follows:

| Category | Rating | Probability of Illegal Mining | Socio-Economic Impact | Restoration Measures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clear Water | 5 | Low | None | None needed |
| Slightly Murky Water | 4 | Moderate | Some fishing activities may be affected | Regular monitoring and enforcement of environmental regulations |
| Murky Water | 3 | High | Fishing activities may be severely impacted, affecting local livelihoods | Immediate enforcement of environmental regulations, removal of pollutants, and restoration of natural habitats |
| Highly Polluted Water | 2 | Very high | Severe impact on fishing activities, affecting local livelihoods and potentially causing health problems | Emergency response to remove pollutants, restoration of natural habitats, and enforcement of environmental regulations |
| Extremely Polluted Water | 1 | Extremely high | Catastrophic impact on fishing activities, affecting local livelihoods, causing health problems, and potentially leading to displacement of communities | Immediate emergency response to remove pollutants, restoration of natural habitats, enforcement of environmental regulations, and potentially relocation of affected communities |

Note: The ratings are subjective and based on the visible water quality in the images. The probability of illegal mining is also subjective and based on the visible signs of pollution in the images. The socio-economic impact and restoration measures are hypothetical and based on general knowledge of the effects of water pollution.
